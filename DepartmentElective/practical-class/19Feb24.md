- __Prime numbers__ are really important in security. because factorisation is not possible, hard to break.

- What are ___Co-primes?___ : Which are relatively primes! although 10 is not prime, 9 and 10 are coprimes because 1 is their __GCD__.

# Eudclidean Algorithm

<br>
<br>

just write down `Q` `r1` `r2` and `r`

```

for two numbers 161,28


Step1:

Q    r1      r2      r

5    161     28      21


Step2: shift left


1    28       21      7

Step3: shift left (until r = 0 )

3     21       7      0



When r = 0, r2 will be the GCD.

```

<br>

>[ Question ] - Using these steps, find out GCD of 272 and 17.


<br>

- if GCD(x,y) == 1; they are coprimes, else they aren't.

# Extended Eudclidean Algorithm

<br>


- We add three new values in extended. (t1, t2, t)

<br>
<br>

> :exclamation: In RSA, we use multiplicative inverse.
>
>- In RSA, there will be three more values, t1, t2, and t
>
>- t = t1 - (q * t2)  [intial value of t1 = 0, t2 = 1]
>
> t value is actually corresponding multiplicative inverse of respective r

# Vigenere Cipher

<br>
<br>

```

key = FIRST

pt = HELLO WORLD

add their values and change


HELLO WORLD HI
FIRST FIRST FI
---------------
M

```

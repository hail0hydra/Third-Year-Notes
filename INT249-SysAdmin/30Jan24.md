# What is NIC?

<br>

> Load Balancing and Traffic management

<br>
<br>

- In every PC we have atleast one NIC. 

- We have a space for the NIC card as well

- In cabinet, there are 2 extra slots for NICs

<br>
<br>

## Why do we need NIC space?

<br>
<br>

- High Traffic (packet loss/delay)



---

<br>

- We use multiple NICs

- Multiple IP addresses

- For such reasons, we use servers that have multiple NICs with same IPs

   - Load Balancing

   - Packet loss solution


- This is called `NIC teaming`

<br>
<br>

- even if one NIC is damaged, the work wont stop

- Team is aware about each other

- Ppts will be given, we have to perform with our PCs

### Modes in NIC

![image](https://images.pexels.com/photos/674010/pexels-photo-674010.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=800)

<br>
<br>

1. ___Switch  (Independant)___ -  Taking record for switches, particularly working for the incoming data. _THIS IS THE DEFAULT MODE_

<br>

2. ___LACP {} (Negotiatable mode)___ - Option to choose which adapter they want, taking record of which adapter is busy for how much time.

<br>

4. ___Static___ -  combination of both, in which you have to choose.
  
<br>

## Load Balancing Mode

<br>
<br>

- Chose which adapter for outgoing and which for incoming traffic.

1. ___Address Hash___ - Use the soure and destination port and IP address to create an effective balance b/w team members. If no port are part of our connection it only us eIP addresss to determine how to load balance. (Can't use MAC address)

<br>

2. ___Hyper-V Port___ - Intended only for use on hyper-v virtual machine host this mode will assign a MAC to each machine on the VM host and they assign a team members teach each of the MAC address.

<br>

3. ___Dynamic___ - use both best features to balance inbound and outbound network traffic. (Inbound - MAC, Outbound - IP).

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Standby Adapter


<br>
<br>

- Equal speed but adapter is damaged, we can use this.


<br>

<br>
<br>

- To set a static IP address:

<br>
<br>

   ```bash

   netsh interface ipv4 set address name="Your Network Interface Name" static <IP Address> <Subnet Mask> <Default Gateway>

   ```

<br>
<br>

- To obtain an IP address automatically (DHCP):

<br>
<br>

   ```bash
   
   netsh interface ipv4 set address name="Your Network Interface Name" source=dhcp

   ```

<br>

<br>

## Cables


<br>
<br>

> ___Guided Media___ (Twisted-Pair, Co-axial, Fiber-Optics)


<br>
<br>

### Twisted-Pair cables

<br>

- Twist to control the speed; else so fast they can even attract you.

- There are conducting wires.

<br>

two types:

<br>

1. __UTP__ : Unshielded Twisted-Pair

<br>

2. __STP__ : Shielded Twister-Pair (With Metal shield)

<br>
<br>

### Co-axial cables

<br>
<br>

```text

Plastic cover --> Insulator --> outer conductor --> inner conductor

```

<br>
<br>

### Optical Fiber cables

<br>
<br>

```text

Outer Jacket --> DuPont Kevlar for strength --> Plastic buffer -->

```

<br>
<br>

#### Color Coding

<br>

- Red, Green, Blue, Brown and then 4 more with white color having waves of each prev colors

<br>

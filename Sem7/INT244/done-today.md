## Scanning

<br>

<br>

<!-- 29-08-2024 -->

## Nmap

<br>
<br>

> üìì Cheatsheet: [here](https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/)

- talked about scanning, spoofing, IDS, firewalls, etc.

<br>
<br>

```bash
nmap -sn network-ip/range
```

- `sn` does a __Ping Scan__ and disables __PORT scan__

- output saved [here](discover.nmap)


<br>

> Alt: we could've used netdiscover for this ü§°

<br>

### Fast scanning


```bash
nmap -F example.com
```

- output of this is [here](example.nmap)


<br>
<br>

### three types of status

1. open

2. closed (stay away)

3. filtered - undetermined, maybe Firewall (stay away)

<br>
<br>

### Banner grabbing in two ways using `-A` and `-O`

    1. Basic OS detection
    ```bash
     nmap -O scanme.nmap.org
     ```


    
    2. More aggressive, does `--script` and others as well

    ```bash
     nmap -A scanme.nmap.org
     ```

<br>
<br>


### __Stealth Scan__

```bash
nmap -sS scanme.nmap.org
```

    - Just doing _Half-Scan_ or _TCP SYN_ scan only


<br>
<br>


### Only see open ports

```bash
nmap --open scanme.nmap.org
```

<br>
<br>

- likewise `-sV` for __service version detetection__

<br>
<br>

### Timing and Performance

```bash
nmap -T0 scanme.nmap.org
```

- takes a lot of time, not much noisy.


<br>
<br>

### Saving results

- Teacher said just redirect it ü§£

- But we can use `-o?`

```bash
nmap example.com -oN / -oX / -Os
```


<br>

- talked about `nslookup`

## Session Hijacking

- Why is session hijacking successful?

- Two types of Session Hijacking

- In OSI Model

    1. Network - Level Hijacking (interception of packets)

    2. Application - Level Hijacking (HTTP user session)


- `Spoofing` vs `Hijacking`

- ___Man in the Browser Attack___

<br>
<br>

### Using Client Side Attacks

1. Cross Site Scripting

2. MITM vs Replay Attacks

3. Performing DOS attack with SYN flooding
